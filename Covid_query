select population,continent,location,date,total_cases,new_cases,total_deaths,new_deaths,

--we need to get the sum of total cases deaths and vaccination per year 
select location, year(date) as year ,population , sum(new_cases) as all_cases,sum(new_deaths) as all_deaths,

group by location, year(date),population
having max(people_vaccinated) is not null and  sum(new_cases) is not null
order by all_cases desc



--next will get the percentage of total deaths per continent
select continent, (sum(new_deaths)/ sum(new_cases)) * 100  as death_percentage from dbo.covid_data#csv$
where continent is not null

group by continent

--will get people vaccinated percentage per location

--will get the number of how many people did not vaccinate 

select location, max(population)- max(people_vaccinated) as ppl_not_vaccinated from dbo.covid_data#csv$

group by location
having max(population)- max(people_vaccinated) is not null
order by 1

--will show the rolling of population that have been fully vaccinated will use window_fuc rather than using sub_query
